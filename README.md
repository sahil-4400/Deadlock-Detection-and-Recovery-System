# OS Deadlock Detection and Recovery System

## Overview
The **OS Deadlock Detection and Recovery System** project addresses the critical issue of deadlocks in operating systems, where processes are unable to proceed due to mutual resource waiting. This project aims to enhance understanding and management of deadlocks through detection algorithms and recovery methods.

## Objectives
- Understand the concepts of deadlocks in operating systems.
- Compare various deadlock detection algorithms, including:
  - Wait-For Graph
  - Banker's Algorithm
- Analyze recovery methods such as:
  - Process termination
  - Resource preemption
- Develop a prototype system to demonstrate detection and recovery techniques visually.

## Features
- Visual representation of deadlock scenarios.
- Implementation of detection algorithms.
- Demonstration of recovery strategies.
- Comprehensive reporting on findings and best practices.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OS-Deadlock-Detection-and-Recovery.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd OS-Deadlock-Detection-and-Recovery
   ```
3. Install any required dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   # Example for Python projects
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the prototype system, execute the following command:
```bash
# Example command
python main.py
```
Follow the on-screen instructions to simulate deadlock scenarios and observe detection and recovery processes.
