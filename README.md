# Deadlock-Detection-and-Recovery-System
The "OS Deadlock Detection and Recovery System" project deals with deadlocks in operating systems, where processes are waiting for the resources of each other. It will try to comprehend deadlock principles, contrast detection algorithms, and examine recovery strategies. A prototype will demonstrate these methods.
